	<h3>An Example Of CNNs Outperforming RNNs in NLP</h3>
	<p>Here, I’ll show an example of how RNN-style architectures can perform very poorly compared to other architectures popular around the time that RNN-style architectures were most popular in the NLP world. In particular, I'll be comparing RNNs to  CNNs and dense neural networks.</p>
	<p>NOTE: The original version of this write-up can be found <a target="_blank" href="old.html">here</a>. It is extremely verbose, which makes it difficult to read. If anything here is insufficiently described, more details can be found in the original post. This version of the write-up is intended to be a more easily consumable summary of the work.</p>

	<h3>Problem Summary</h3>
	<p>The problem we’re trying to solve here is to assign articles from the <a target="_blank" href="http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/reuters21578/reuters21578.html">Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Collection</a> with the possibly many topics relevant to them.</p>
	<p>For example, we might want to assign this text:</p>
	<div class="code-block">
	  The Panamanian bulk carrier Juvena is
	  still aground outside Tartous, Syria, despite discharging 6,400
	  tons of its 39,000-ton cargo of wheat, and water has entered
	  the engine-room due to a crack in the vessel bottom, Lloyds
	  Shipping Intelligence Service said.
	  The Juvena, 53,351 tonnes dw, ran aground outside Tartous
	  port basin breakwater on February 25 in heavy weather and rough
	  seas.
	  Reuter
	</div>
	<p>to have the labels <code>grain</code>, <code>ship</code>, and <code>wheat</code>.</p>

	<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
	<p>The articles in <a target="_blank" href="http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/reuters21578/reuters21578.html">Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Collection</a> have many labels.</p>
	<p>Some topics have an insufficient number of articles associated with them, e.g. some topics only have 2 articles (not enough to have even 1 in each of the training, validation, and testing splits). </p>
	<p>We removed all topics with fewer than 200 articles.</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>Blindly assuming that RNNs would be the best choice, I wasted a huge amount of time and encountered a huge amount of frustration trying to figure out why my RNN models were performing so poorly.</p>
	<p>After having used the exact same code on a different problem (see <a target="_blank" href="https://paul-tqh-nguyen.github.io/impact_of_attention/">here</a>), I suspected that perhaps the problem was not in my implementation but rather in my architecture choice.</p>
	<p>From this experience, the best conclusion that I could come to was that my blind assumption about the dominance of RNNs was false.</p>
	<p>A lesson perhaps learned the hard way, but a good one to have learned.</p>
	<p>I hope you found this useful. If you have any question or suggestions for improvement, <a target="_blank" href="https://paul-tqh-nguyen.github.io/about/#contact">please let me know</a>!</p>
